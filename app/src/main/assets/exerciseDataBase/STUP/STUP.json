  "stepByStepInstructions": [
    "Lie down on a workout mat.\n",
    "Bend your knees to a 90-degree angle, with your heels and toes touching the ground, if possible. Keep your legs close together and no wider than hip-width apart. Anchor your feet if necessary.\n",
    "Place your hands on the sides of your head, lightly touching your head with your fingertips. Lie flat on your back, looking up. You’re now in the starting position.\n",
    "Control your upper body by bending at the hips, moving your head towards your knees. When your upper body or abdomen touches your legs, the movement is complete. Return to the starting position in a controlled manner. To make the workout more effective, maintain tension in your abdominal muscles, even in the starting position, and don’t relax on your back.\n"

  "commonMistake": [
    "Avoid swinging during sit-ups, as it’s a common mistake that reduces the effectiveness of the exercise.",
    "Don’t pull your head up when your hands are crossed behind it, as this can also lead to a swinging movement and increase the risk of injury due to excessive neck stretching. Be cautious with this hand placement and keep your arms loose on the sides/behind your head.\n",
    "For traditional sit-ups, keep your feet on the ground throughout the exercise. Don’t lift your feet just because the repetition is difficult.\n"
