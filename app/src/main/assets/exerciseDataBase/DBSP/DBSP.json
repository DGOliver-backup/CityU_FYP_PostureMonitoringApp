    "Set the back of the incline bench to the steepest setting, place the dumbbells in front of the bench, and take a seat.\n",
    "Grab the dumbbells, place them on your knees (see video above), and hold them tight.\n",
    "Lean all the way back, so your shoulder blades press against the backrest.\n",
    "Push your butt all the way back, so your lower back and butt touch the backrest and form a slight hollow back.\n",
    "Use your knees to lift the dumbbells one at a time and bring them next to your head. The backs of your hands should point backwards. Your elbows should be bent at about a right angle and point slightly forward. This is the starting position.\n",
    "Now press the dumbbells straight up, above your head. Keep your grip the same (backs of the hands pointing backwards). The dumbbells may touch a little, but don’t let them slam against each other. Don’t fully extend your elbows; maintain a slight bend to avoid overloading your joints and losing muscle tension.\n",
    "Slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position in a controlled manner.\n"

  "commonMistake": ["A frequent mistake is incorrect elbow positioning. Ensure your elbows don’t point backward when lowering the weights. A subtle forward positioning of the elbows is better for your joints. Also, only lower your elbows slightly below shoulder level and don’t go any further.\n"],
