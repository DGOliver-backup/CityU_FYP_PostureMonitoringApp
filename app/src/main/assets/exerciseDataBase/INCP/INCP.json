    "Sit on the seat cushion and lean back. Your head and back should touch the backrest. Plant your feet firmly on the ground to stabilize your body in this position.\n",
    "Hold the handles with an upper grip (palms facing up).\n",
    "Push the weight slightly forward to feel tension in your chest. You’re now in the starting position.\n",
    "Next, push the handles forward or upward. Keep your back and head pressed against the backrest. Don’t fully extend your arms; keep your elbows a bit bent. Hold this position briefly, then slowly and controlled, return the weight to the starting position.\n"
  ],
  "commonMistake": ["Set the seat height so that when you hold the grips, your hands are about at the level of your lower chest. This ensures optimal chest muscle engagement and joint protection.\n",
    "Make sure not to fully extend your elbows at the end of the push movement; keep them slightly bent. Additionally, don’t rest the weight in the starting position; always maintain a slight pull.\n"
