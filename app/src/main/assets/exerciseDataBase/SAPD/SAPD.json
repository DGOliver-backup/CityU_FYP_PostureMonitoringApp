    "Attach the handle to the top of the cable machine.\n",
    "Stand in front of the tower and grab the handle about shoulder-width apart.\n",
    "Take a small step back and, if needed, pull the handle down slightly.\n",
    "Lean your upper body forward a bit and gently arch your back. This is the starting position.\n",
    "With your arms extended, pull the handle down towards your hips.\n",
