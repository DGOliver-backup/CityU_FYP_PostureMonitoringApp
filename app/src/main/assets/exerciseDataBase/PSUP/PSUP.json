  "stepByStepInstructions": [
    "Kneel on the floor and lean your upper body forward far enough, so you can support yourself with your hands (shoulder width).\n",
    "Extend both legs and balance on your toes.\n",
    "Extend both arms and move your hands so they’re roughly below your shoulders. If you like, you can vary the width of your support in this step (see above).\n",
    "Tense your core so that your head, upper body, and legs form a nearly straight line. Don’t stick your butt out too far and don’t let your pelvis sag. You’re now in the starting position.\n",
    "Slowly and controlled, lower your upper body down by bending your arms. End the movement when your chest is just above the floor. If you’re using a higher support position for your arms or legs, end the movement when your elbows are fully bent.\n",
    "Hold the position for a brief moment and then straighten your arms (almost) all the way. Keep your body tensed throughout the entire movement in the manner described earlier.\n"

  "commonMistake": ["The body posture during push-ups is crucial for good muscle stimulation. Often, you see people either sticking their butt out too far or letting their hips sag. Both are negative for the effectiveness of the exercise. To perform push-ups correctly, make sure your body is straight, and your core stays tense. Your head, upper body, and legs should form a line.\n"
