  "stepByStepInstructions": [
    "Attach the two handles to the upper cable pulleys.\n",
    "Stand in the center of the cable machine, with your feet about shoulder-width apart.\n",
    "Lean to one side, grasp the first handle in an underhand grip (palms facing inward) with your arm extended but slightly bent at the elbow, and pull it towards the center of your body.\n",
    "Pull the handles towards your head by bending your elbows. Keep your shoulders still throughout the movement.\n"
  ],
  "commonMistake": ["Donâ€™t fully extend your elbows and lose tension at the end of the movement, as this puts a lot of stress on your elbows and shoulders, especially with heavy weights.\n",
    "Move the weight by bending your elbows only. Your shoulders and upper body should ideally stay still during the exercise.\n"
